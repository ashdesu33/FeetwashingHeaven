        <p>Feetwashing Heaven is an art collective formed by Nor Wu, Ash Ma, and Lily Wu, initially started in Providence, RI.<br><br>

            As international designers, artists, and crafters, we are always traveling: bouncing between places, seeking and cultivating community as home. Through our journey around the world, weâ€™ve become acutely aware of how art and design became more of the justification of language that demands rules and clarity, when the world itself operates in absurdity. Our work resists these expectations by embracing nonsense, instability, and expression without hierarchy.
            
            <br><br>We focus on experimental publications, risograph zines, and hybrid forms that merge print, ceramics, and image-making. We treat publishing as both language and space, something that is tactile, humorous, and instinctive.
            
            <br><br>Feetwashing Heaven was previously exhibited at 296 Benefit and RISD GD Commencement.</p>
